## u8g2-sim

This is an attempt to speed up UI development for Arduino projects using the U8G2 library ([https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2/](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2/)).

You can see a running demo here: [https://p3dt.net/u8g2sim/](https://p3dt.net/u8g2sim/)

Hint: it is still very buggy. Please report bugs via github üëç

This is a lot of copy & paste from the original project u8g2.
